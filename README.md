# 📚 Full Stack CRUD Application with gRPC, Flutter, TypeScript, XAMPP, and Ngrok 🚀

This project is a powerful full-stack CRUD application that utilizes **gRPC** for fast and efficient communication, **Flutter** for a sleek and modern frontend, and **TypeScript** for a type-safe backend. The backend is hosted on **XAMPP** for easy local development, with **Ngrok** used to securely expose the local environment for external access and testing. The application supports all **gRPC transport methods**, including **unary**, **server streaming**, **client streaming**, and **bidirectional streaming**, enabling robust, real-time communication across the board.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: gRPC, TypeScript, XAMPP
- **Local Environment**: Ngrok
- **Database**: (Specify your database, e.g., MySQL/MongoDB/PostgreSQL, etc.)
